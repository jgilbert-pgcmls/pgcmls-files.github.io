          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>The Maryland Room opened officially on September 17, 1964, having been planned into the overall design for the library by the Architectural firm of Walton and Madden, Mt. Rainier. The decor reflects that of a parlor or library in a Colonial Manor House of the 18th century, and one literally feels as though stepping back in time upon crossing the threshold! </p>
          <p>The collection is continuously updated with newly or re-published historical, genealogical, and other materials centered on Maryland or parts thereof. While Prince Georges County and other Maryland counties and cities are most heavily represented, there are historical and genealogical materials for the District of Columbia and Virginia as well. </p>
          <p>The Friends of the Hyattsville Library continue to do much to enhance the splendid appearance of the room. A massive reupholstering project was completed in 1999, and new furniture has been added just recently.</p>
